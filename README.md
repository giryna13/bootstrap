# bootstrap

What is Bootstrap? It's a free open source framework, created by Twitter in 2011. It contains lots of predefined templates for grids, buttons, images, forms and more, which allows developers to design websites blazingly fast. This is especially important when preparing prototypes of minimum viable products that should look moderately appealing, but the programmer does not wish to bother with creating custom design or JavaScript plugins.

In the past years Bootstrap has significantly evolved. It now boasts mobile-first approach, responsive flexbox-based grid, a handful of JavaScript extensions, and much more. The most recent version of the framework is 4.1
